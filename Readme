# MATH 509 Final Project

### Project Description

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, finding personalized recommendations for
books, movies, games, and social media influencers can be overwhelming. Our project aims to
address this challenge by developing a user-friendly Recommender System (RS) that simplifies
the process of discovering enjoyable content across various platforms. By leveraging
Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques, our RS will provide
fast and accurate recommendations tailored to individual preferences.
List of Goals:
1. Develop an efficient and scalable RS capable of handling large datasets and delivering
real-time recommendations to users.
2. Incorporate Collaborative Filtering algorithms, including Memory-Based Collaborative
Filtering and Model-Based Collaborative Filtering, to analyze user preferences and
generate personalized recommendations.
3. Utilize Matrix Factorization techniques to learn latent user preferences and item
attributes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.
4. Design an intuitive user interface that enables users to interact effortlessly with the RS
and receive personalized recommendations across different content categories.
5. Fine-tune the performance of the RS to ensure swift response times and efficient
resource utilization, thereby providing users with a seamless experience.
6. Conduct thorough evaluations and testing to gauge the effectiveness and accuracy of
the RS in generating relevant recommendations for users.
By achieving these goals, our project aims to simplify the process of discovering enjoyable
content for users while making a valuable contribution to the field of Recommender Systems
